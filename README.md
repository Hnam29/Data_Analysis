# DataAnalyst 
Click [here](https://hector29dataapp.streamlit.app/) to view the web application.

1. Data Analysis
2. Using Streamlit to deploy the web application 
3. I am interested in making a data analysis application for addressing the daily issues that a Data Analyst might implement. 
4. Streamlit documentation: https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference
5. Workflow: datasets (data scraping) -> data analysis -> data visualization -> data storytelling
6. Outputs:
7. Shortcomings: 
  - Analyzing data has not covered the data pre-processing part 
  - Visuals are lacking of some types -> Continue to update
  - Storytelling should be based on the actual insights
  - Scraping data: can use other packages (Selenium, beautifulSoup, Scrapy) -> Comparing the efficiency 
8. Future work:
  - Deploying the Machine Learning 
  - Focusing on Predictive and Prescriptive Analysis
9. Installation
  - Requiring virtual env (recommend using Anaconda)
  - pip install streamlit
